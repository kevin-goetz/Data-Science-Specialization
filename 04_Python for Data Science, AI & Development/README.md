# Python for Data Science, AI & Development

## Description
This course aims to teach Python fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate the new skills. 

By the end of this course, the participant feels comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and solving real-world problems in Python.

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this course are:
- Python build-in Data Strcutures (Lists, Tuples, Dicts, Sets, Floats, Ints, Strings, etc.)
- Variables and Expressions
- Conditional Code
- Functions & Methods
- Loops and Iteration
- Exception Handling
- Web Scraping & APIs
- Basics of NumPy & Pandas


## Assignments & Certificate
This course spans over multiple weeks and it has at least one or more of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 10 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
After immersing myself in IDEs and Text Editors for programming with Python, I find Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (or just "Code") to be the best fit between writing programs and doing Data Science work (e.g. EDA). With the extensions "Python" and "Jupyter" installed, one can have the benefits of a fully fledged IDE and a Notebook.

Don't use a list for every occasion that needs a container. Every use case has its own requirement for speed and flexibility and the methods and possibilities between the data structures vary a lot.

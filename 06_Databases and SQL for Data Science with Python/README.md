# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

## Description
This course teaches relational database concepts, can construct and execute SQL queries, and has demonstrated hands-on experience accessing data from databases using Python-based Data Science tools like Jupyter notebooks.

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this course are:
- Architecture of RDBMS
- DDL & DML with SQL
- DB querying with Python sqlalchemy
- sqlmagic commands
- Db2 (IBM Database)

## Assignments & Certificate
This course spans over multiple weeks and it has at least one or more of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 10 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
There are different options for querying a database within a python script. To name two of them: sqlite and sqlalchemy. I learned that Sqlite3 is a file-based RDBMS, which can be better compared with things such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL, etc. It is used to store and retrieve structured data from files and you can build your own RDBMS as a self-contained file.

On the other hand sqlalchemy is an object relational mapper (ORM). It does what it suggests: it maps your databases (tables, etc.) to Python objects, so that you can more easily and natively interact with them. The advantage is that it lets you interact with your database models consistently across database engines.

The best thing I learned though was that there is something called "sqlmagic commands" within Jupyter notebooks, that let you define the connection string at the beginning of your file and then it just needs a "%%sql" at the top of the cell to let it switch to SQL so you can query your database without an explicit connection- and cursor-object. If you are interested in learning this I can highly recommend this [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-magics-with-sql-921370099589) and also this [Medium article](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sql-interface-within-jupyterlab).

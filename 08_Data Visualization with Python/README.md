# Data Visualization with Python

## Description
This course teaches an understanding of what data visualization is, uses of data visualization, and best practices when creating plots and visuals. The individual has the skills to use different Python Libraries, mainly Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate different types of visualization tools such as line plots, scatter plots, bubble plots, area plots, histograms, and bar charts.

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this course are:
- Data Visualization with different Plots using:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Folium
  - Plotly/Dash

## Assignments & Certificate
This course spans over multiple weeks and it has at least one or more of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 10 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
Data Visualizations are not just good for EDA, they are also the best way to communicte insights and to tell the data story. Most of the times less is more though: just because a graph looks fancy doesn't mean it is the best choice (talking to you tree maps, chord charts and often pie charts). In the end it is all about explaining the most important information quickly to the viewer.

I was really looking forward to learning Plotly/Dash until I realized how much work it takes to build the most basic dashboard. Coming from a Business Intelligence background I can highly recommend to learn Tableau or PowerBI instead because they have a lot of possibilities and you can generate nice Dashboards very quickly. And most of the times it is just that: Generating insights and delivering them in a short amount of time (think ROI with your time).

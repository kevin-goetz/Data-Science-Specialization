# Python Project for Data Science

## Description
This course is intended to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data. The completion of this course involves working on a hands-on project where you will develop a simple visualization of API & Web Scraping data using Python.

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this specialization are:
- Web Scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup)
- EDA (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Data Visualization (Plotly)


## Assignments & Certificate
This course is hands-on only and has the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises (small project)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 10 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
There are Python libraries for everything! Instead of using a developer account for an API you can (if applicable) also use a library that is already dedicated to the task, like yfinance for extracting stock data. This makes it way easier to work with APIs, but it is also not that flexible of course. It is always a trade-off between flexibility & transparency to ease of use I guess.

Also, the combination of different data sources (like Web Scraping & API) makes the insights and the project much more interesting. The combination of data sources itself can bring huge insights even before applying special ML algorithms.

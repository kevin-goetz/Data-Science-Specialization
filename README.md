# Data-Science-Specialization

## Description
This 10-course Data Science specialization from the IBM Professional Certificate (hosted on Coursera) teaches you how to apply Data Science methodology, work with Jupyter notebooks, create Python apps, access relational databases using SQL & Python, use Python libraries to generate data visualizations, perform data analysis using Pandas, construct & evaluate Machine Learning (ML) models using Scikit-learn & SciPy and apply data science & ML techniques to real location data sets.

## Courses
This specialization has 10 courses, each of them covering different topics and python packages. **The first 3 courses are theory-based and therefore not included in this repo**. The courses are:
1. What is Data Science?
2. Tools for Data Science
3. Data Science Methodology
4. [Python for Data Science, AI & Development](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/04_Python%20for%20Data%20Science%2C%20AI%20%26%20Development)
5. [Python Project for Data Science](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/05_Python%20Project%20for%20Data%20Science)
6. [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/06_Databases%20and%20SQL%20for%20Data%20Science%20with%20Python)
7. [Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/07_Data%20Analysis%20with%20Python)
8. [Data Visualization with Python](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/08_Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python)
9. [Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/09_Machine%20Learning%20with%20Python)
10. [Applied Data Science Capstone Project](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/10_Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone)

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this specialization are:
- Python built-in Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, Integers, Strings, Floats, etc.)
- Data Wrangling (Pandas, Numpy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly)
- ML Algorithms (Classification, Clustering, Regression, Recommender Systems with Scikit-learn & SCIPy)
- Foursquare API
- Databases (RDBMS)
- SQL & Sqlite
- Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Requests, urllib)

For a more detailed list please visit the course folders of this Repo (links above ‚òùÔ∏è).

## Assignments & Certificate
Each of the 10 courses spans over multiple weeks. Every week usually has at least one of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)
- Peer Reviews

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform, peer reviews are graded by your fellow student colleagues who are also attending the course.
If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 10 certificates, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
I recommend skipping the first 3 courses (or not wasting too much time on them if you want to have the 10-course certificate) because they are solely theory-based and sometimes feel like a sales from IBM for their products. The only thing you should really look into is the Data Science Life Cycle, or "Foundational Methodology of Data Science", how IBM calls it. It's a modern extension of the CRISP-DM and well explained. You can find more infos here: [Foundational Methodology of Data Science](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj9_bbawuLyAhUYgf0HHQABB90QFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftdwi.org%2F~%2Fmedia%2F64511A895D86457E964174EDC5C4C7B1.PDF&usg=AOvVaw3bMM2hPvVfl0qo94Tg0JPA)

The other courses are hands on and you can learn a lot from them, especially if you play around with the code and do not copy/paste everything before trying to solve it from scratch.

**More specific learnings for each topic are in the course folder's README!**

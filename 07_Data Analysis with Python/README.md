# Data Analysis with Python

## Description
This course teaches core skills in Data Analysis using Python. They can readily clean, visualize and summarize data using Pandas. Using Scikit-learn, the earner can develop Data Pipelines, construct Machine learning models for Regression and evaluate these models. 

## Skills
Technical skills learned in this course are:
- EDA (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Wrangling (Pandas, NumPy)
- Model Development (Scikit-learn)
- Model Evaluation & Refinement (Scikit-learn)

## Assignments & Certificate
This course spans over multiple weeks and it has at least one or more of the following assignments:
- Coding Exercises
- Quizzes (Multiple Choice)

The coding exercises & quizzes are auto-graded by the platform. If you pass a specific threshold (e.g. 80%), you pass the course and get the certificate. If you collect all 10 course certificates within this specialization, you get the specialization certificate.

## Personal Learnings
Data is imperfect, we all know that. Therefore it is not only important to clean the messy strings with regular expressions etc., it is also important to know the options when it comes to missing values. In this course I learned to identify and deal with missings and I got to know different imputation methods (mean, mode, or more sophisticated algorithms from scikit-learn) and how to apply thresholds for deleting rows (dropna parameters).

In the Model Assesment stage I also learned that there are built-in scikit-learn classes to evaluate the models performance (Cross-Validation for low bias and variance properties) and to tune hyperparameters in an efficient way (CVGridSearch, RandomizedSearch).
